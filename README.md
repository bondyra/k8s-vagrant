# What is this?
This is kubernetes setup in vagrant & ansible, designated for local VirtualBox deployment:
- `hard-way` folder contains detailed configuration based on slightly adjusted Kubernetes the Hard Way repo (https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
- `cka-playground` is a single-master kubeadm-based setup as simplified as possible, used by me as a playground for CKA training (multi-master is possible e.g. by using nginx from KHTW folder in this repo but is not valuable for this use case - and horribly time consuming to get right)

Refer to READMEs in each folder to get more detailed how to use them.
